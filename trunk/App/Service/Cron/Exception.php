 * Object Role Modeling (ORM) is a powerful method for designing and querying
 * database models at the conceptual level, where the application is described in
 * terms easily understood by non-technical users. In practice, ORM data models
 * often capture more business rules, and are easier to validate and evolve than
 * data models in other approaches.

 * specializing in Web Application, Mobile Application and Multimedia. xgoon's combination of experience
 * and specialization on Internet technologies extends our customers' competitive
